### Learning Git with PyCharm and python
This repository is for Code Club usage. It's for a small tutorial on git pycharm collaborative working and understanding OO concepts in python

OO Concepts known as object orientated concepts are the corner stone of modern programming.

### Dry is a concept that refers to Do Not Repeat yourself
Many times in programming you find yourself repeating yourself this is painful to do and is better to just abstract logic to a module or class that is repeatable.

### Abstraction
Is to recognise a repeated pattern then asbtract the logic to a class/module or function to do one job.

### Objects
An Object
1. encapsulates code and data to implement a particular functionality.
2. has an interface that lets clients to access its functionality in an uniform manner.
3. is easily pluggable with another module that expects its interface.
4. is usually packaged in a single unit so that it can be easily deployed.

### Module
A Python module is simply a Python source file, which can expose classes, functions and global variables. When imported from another Python source file, the file name is treated as a namespace. A Python package is simply a directory of Python module(s).

### Package
A package is a collection of Python modules: while a module is a single Python file, a package is a directory of Python modules containing an additional __init__.py file, to distinguish a package from a directory that just happens to contain a bunch of Python scripts.


### Tkinter
A way of making GUI's in python (sidenote there are better libraries)
