### Learning Git with PyCharm and python
This repository js for Code Club usage. It's for a small tutorial on git pychamr collaborative working and understanding OO concepts in python

OO Concepts known as object orientated concepts are the corner stone of modern programming.

### Dry is a concept that refers to Do Not Repeat yourself
Many times in programming you find yourself repeating yourself this is painful to do and is better to just abstract logic to a module or class that is repeatable.

### Abstraction
Is to recognise a repeated pattern then asbtract the logic to a class/module or function to do one job.

### Objects
Like a variable can be anything.

### Module
A Python module is simply a Python source file, which can expose classes, functions and global variables. When imported from another Python source file, the file name is treated as a namespace. A Python package is simply a directory of Python module(s).

### Package
A package is a collection of Python modules: while a module is a single Python file, a package is a directory of Python modules containing an additional __init__.py file, to distinguish a package from a directory that just happens to contain a bunch of Python scripts.


### Tkinter
A way of making GUI's in python (sidenote there are better libraries)

### Reflection
TODO:: need to explain this further
